Word Wheel
=====

This is a little webapp to play "word wheel" puzzles.  It works both for
puzzles similar to (the now-removed) <https://brainbashers.com/webwords.asp>
(which don't allow letters to be repeated), and for puzzles like New York Times
Spelling Bee (which do).

Use the "make-word-wheel-puzzle" script in the associated "word-puzzle-utils"
repo to generate the puzzles.
